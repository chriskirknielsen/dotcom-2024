A little look back at what I have consumed in media this year, and a few bonus "personal" ones for good measure. Warning, there are a lot of bullet points ahead…

## Personal
- I launched a [**new version** of this site](https://chriskirknielsen.com/blog/2024-redesign/) in April, with more themes and more fonts. Lots of fun with CSS! I think my favourite themes are Quill and Campfire. I have made myriad changes since launch; this is my [worry stone](https://ethanmarcotte.com/wrote/let-a-website-be-a-worry-stone/).
- I ran a **half-marathon** in May. My feet were obliterated. People run double this distance? (or more!) Absolutely unhinged, and incredibly impressive. I also noticed my running frequency has dramatically decreased this year… bad Chris, bad!
- We moved to a **new apartment** in July. The landlady is nice and very responsive, unlike the previous place… and water doesn't leak from the ceiling during storms!
- I gained the title of **"Uncle Chris"** twice more this year, though I sadly live very far from all my [niblings](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/nibling).
- I **gave blood** and nearly passed out. I should give blood more often. (a decent new year resolution)

## Movies
I saw a total of 28 movies this year, a few are rewatches (old comforts and all that).
- **Weird: The Al Yankovic Story**: Daniel Radcliffe is perfect, that's all.
- **Oppenheimer**: Christopher Nolan knows how to keep you on the ege of your seat.
- **M3GAN**: Partly creepy, partly funny, I enjoyed this one, maybe even more thanks to the GLaDOS-like voice they used for the titular android.
- **Joe Pera: Slow & Steady**: Joe Pera is a vibe, and very enjoyable one at that.
- **The Saint**: I had never seen this Val Kilmer action thriller — it was a little cheesy but pretty good!
- **Heat**: Rewatched this, still good and quite tense.
- **Red Planet**: A bit of a Val Kilmer kick going on… not much to remember here but it was good enough.
- **Dredd**: I knew what to expect and it delivered, more gory than I thought it would be. Karl Urban is a treat, even in an ultra-stoic role like this.
- **Johnny Mnemonic**: A pretty fun cyberpunk-y Keanu Reeves movie. The "_I WANT ROOM SERVICE!_" quote is cemented in my brain forever.
- **The Super Mario Bros. Movie**: I'm not a huge Mario fan but this was okay ("okay" video game adaptations are worth highlighting!), though the cast was a little too star-powered. (Chris Pratt? Ugh…)
- **Bullet Train**: There were some parts I thought were weird but overall this was entertaining.
- **Kiss Kiss Bang Bang**: Another rewatch, another Val Kilmer movie. The banter between Kilmer and Downey is great. "_Look up “idiot” in the dictionary, you know what you will find?_"
- **Dune: Part Two**: Lovely design, great music, but besides riding a sandworm, I can't recall what happens.
- **Godzilla Minus One**: This deserved every praise, I really enjoyed it.
- **Poor Things**: This is a fever dream through and through. Well acted and not without its comedy bits. Emma Stone crushed it and Willem Dafoe is brilliant as always.
- **Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle**: Starring The Rock playing The Rock and Kevin Hart playing Kevin Hart, I liked that it didn't try to copy the original movie. Didn't finish watching the _Next Level_ sequel…
- **Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One**: Tom Cruise is a scientologist, and that is one fucked-up cult. As a perhaps pointless form of protest, I stream those movies on services where it's included so I don't give out extra money to him and his cult. This was very entertaining, but the motorcycle jump scene kind of seemed pointless despite all the buzz around it.
- **Hit Man**: An overhyped Netflix movie, why not… The premise is fun but halfway through the tone shifts to not-fun and I didn't vibe with that.
- **Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness**: Honestly it could have been worse but I thought it was supposed to be kinda horror-ish and felt like yet another Marvel movie instead with a couple of darker tones. Also can we be done with all this multiverse stuff?
- **Thor: Love and Thunder**: Another Marvel, I know… This movie has its moments, but sometimes you get these quips in the middle of serious scenes and it ruins it. Christian Bale did a fantastic job at being creepy though!
- **Black Widow**: This is your typical spy-against-previous-agency action movie, with a triple-shot of that Marvel formula. Scarlett Johansson's character deserved better than this to close Black Widow's storyline, but it was okay otherwise. David Harbour is a lot of fun, and it's even made me consider watching that _Thunderbolts_ spin-off (one day… maybe).
- **Ghostbusters: Afterlife**: Some of the characters were a little annoying but overall this was a decent reboot-sequel with some nice throwbacks. And Paul Rudd playing Paul Rudd is always a treat.
- **The Nightmare Before Christmas**: This movie is shorter than I remembered, and a little more all over the place, but I still enjoyed it.
- **Deadpool & Wolverine**: Some highs and lows. Could have done without Wesley Snipe and other (cliché) things, but also had a few good laughs.
- **National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation**: A classic! It makes very little sense after rewatching it so many times and being more analytical, but it was good to have in the background while preparing the Christmas dinner (Danish frikadeller with brown sauce, and red cabbage: easy to make, easy to enjoy, especially as leftovers).
- **Jingle All the Way**: This movie has so much going on. Nothing is really addressed, and Schwarzenegger's character just lucks out in making his family not hate him. Also reindeer shouldn't drink beer… right?
- **Despicable Me**: I didn't see the full movie but I'd already seen it before. I should watch the sequels… I really like this kind of animated movie.

## TV shows
Shows are obviously a bigger time investment than movies, so I didn't get through a lot, especially since I'm catching up on existing shows with many seasons readily available…
- **Taskmaster**: Got through series 12 to 16 this year (started at season 7, haven't caught up backwards). This nonsensical task-based show is usually quite hilarious and you quickly grow fond of the contestants (5 new comedians every series). The original show is available on YouTube outside the UK, by the way!
- **Better Call Saul**: I saw season 2, started 3x01, and just stopped. I really need to get back into it, I think it's a fantastic show.
- **Bob's Burgers**: It took me 7 years (yes) to see all of season 1, then a year to get to season 8. It's a pretty wholesome show, all the characters are lovable goofs, despite their many, many flaws.
- **Andor**: I liked this show, but it didn't feel super Star Wars-y because there is like one robot, maybe two aliens, and about fourty million humans throughout. (and that Syril is so damn annoying!) Still, pretty good.
- **Detroiters**: Thanks to some co-workers, I have been pulled into the _I Think You Should Leave_ universe. Having watched all three seasons of _ITYSL_, I started Detroiters when it landed on Netflix. I've only seen a few episodes but it's definitely the same brand of humor. Like _Bob's Burgers_, the characters are flawed but loveable.

## Music
Not a lot of stuff going on here for me this year. _Bring Me the Horizon_ released a new album that was just okay, but nothing else hit my radar, so I've been listening to previous releases.
- **Thrice**: My top-listened to band, still winning that achievement this year. I'm supposedly in the top 0.1% of listeners, whatever that means. Not a huge surprise given they are my favourite band.
- **Sleep Token**: I discovered this band last year, maybe two years ago? I went absolutely goblin-mode on their music. Their newest album _Take Me Back To Eden_ is wonderful.
- **Muse**: Between _Absolution_, _Black Holes and Revelations_, _The Resistance_, and _Simulation Theory_ (plus a Thin White Duke remix of _Undisclosed Desires_), I ended up listening to a lot of Muse. Nostalgia works very well on me.
- **Tool**: While Tool is likely the most listened to of the three projects by Maynard James Keenan, I also dedicated a fair chunk of time to _A Perfect Circle_ and _Puscifer_. It can be trippy, but mostly it's great music.

## Books
I really wanted to try to read one book a month this year (a lofty goal for me!) but after a couple of books I lost steam. I read before going to sleep, and get sleepy very fast, so the 26th letter of the alphabet is what I catch most of.
- **The Invincible** (Stanisław Lem): I played the game of the same name then read the book. I enjoyed both, great atompunk vibes.
- **In Truth and Claw** (Ari Marmell): I haven't read the previous books and will likely not read the rest. This was okay but I didn't get hooked on the universe.
- **Early Riser** (Jasper Fforde): Sara Joy talked about this — perhaps on Mastodon? — and I got intrigued. It was good! Worldbuilding was on point even when it sounded ludicrous.
- **The Wager: A Tale of Shipwreck, Mutiny and Murder** (David Grann): My friend Clément told me to read this last year and I finally did! Super interesting, but given it's based on a true story, also frightening.
- **Moonbound** (Robin Sloan): I heard about it via Robin Rendle and it piqued my interest. It took me months but I liked this one a lot: it mixes science-fiction and fantasy in a coherent story, good stuff.
- **Station Eleven** (Emily St. John Mandel): Another recommendation from my friend Clément, due to some _The Last of Us_ vibes he thought I'd like. Not done reading it but I'm enjoying the web of stories so far.

## Games
I played a total of 14 video games this year, though if it weren't for _FFVII Rebirth_, I'd likely have spent my time more wisely. Anyway…
- **The Invincible**: This atompunk-inspired game was good (_Firewatch_-y vibes). A little slow in the gameplay but an enjoyable story altogether.
- **Abriss**: This is a physics-based game where you build contraptions to destroy structures. Lots of fun, though a little frustrating at times due to wonky physics.
- **Beyond Good & Evil**: I never finished this one back on my brother's PC, so the 20th anniversary re-release was a good opportunity to do it! The game has aged relatively well.
- **Gris**: This little story wrapped in a lovely art style caught my eye. It's a one-and-done kind of game and I loved it.
- **Final Fantasy VII Rebirth**: This game destroyed me. Especially my self-imposed quest for the platinum trophy. There were too many mini-games and too many difficult challenges that, by the end, took out any enjoyment. Solid story and gameplay though!
- **Akimbot**: This small game by a French studio with some _Ratchet & Clank_ vibes was pretty fun! A few frustrating vehicle sections but overall it was a good time.
- **Astro Bot**: Platforming is back, babyyy! This love letter to the PlayStation was so much fun (and adorable).
- **Unravel**: I had some free time and decided to finally finish this game after 7 years left untouched. It was cute! I finished every level without dying to get a trophy. Trophies are like cocaine to my completionist-driven brain, it is a curse.
- **The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild**: I rarely game on the Switch, so it was clunky to control for me, but I did beat the game, and had quite a lot of fun. I'm holding out on _Tears of the Kingdom_ until I get the itch again.
- **Alan Wake II**: The first entry was good, but this one took it to a whole new level. While not perfect, I still think it's an amazing game, with some DLC that had me very hyped for _Control_'s sequel.
- **NieR: Automata**: This was… interesting. The game was pretty good, with some decently fun gameplay and music, and the kind of mandatory "New Game Plus" to get the full story. Not sure why the protagonists need to run around in underwear, though…
- **Neva**: Same developer as _Gris_, same vibes, too. Also a one-and-done, it was quite beautiful and the relationship between the protagonist and her wolf was sweet.
- **Jak and Daxter: The Precursor Legacy**: I replayed this for the heck of it. One of my favourites, it still hold up, though the controls (especially for the camera) are a bit dated.
- **Jusant**: This was a relaxing little climbing adventure. The music was particularly pleasant, and the environmental storytelling was very neat!
- **Viewfinder**: Currently playing this puzzle game (love a good puzzle!). This one is like _Superliminal_ but with polaroids and I'm enjoying it so far!

## Totally justified expenses
I splurged a little bit here and there but definitely needed these things, and it wasn't just to fill a CPU-shaped hole in my heart.
- **8bitdo Retro Mechanical Keyboard** (SNES version): I bought this because it looked cool.
- **Retro DualSense Controller** (PS1 anniversary colourway): I treated myself to a PS5 controller because it looked cool.
- **MacBook Pro M4** (14"): I replaced my 2019 16-inch MacBook Pro because it wasn't working well any more (done via Apple trade-in, so hopefully it gets a good second life). I thought I'd miss the larger form factor, but not at all: it's light to move around, big win.
- **iPhone 13 Mini** (refurbished): I replaced my Android Pixel 3a phone as it was getting buggy and slow, and was also a tad too big. I am now fully invested into the Apple ecosystem, for better or worse.

## That’s about it
And those are all the bullet points to sum up my media diet and a little bit of personal stuff this year. I don't mention my job as nothing really changed there, but on the side, I created some more [Designs](/designs/), including a CSS logo that wasn't selected for the new official rebrand (though I did help find a font, so I'm super happy I could contribute a tiny bit to it!). While I don't make much from those, I can't tell you how lovely it is for me every time I get an email letting me know somebody bought something I designed!

That's it… happy new year to y'all!
