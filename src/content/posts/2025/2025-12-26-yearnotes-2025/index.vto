			title: 'Station Eleven',
			eyebrow: 'Emily St. John Mandel',
			content: '_(started reading this one in late 2024)_ I liked this one a lot, it had reasonably believable characters and situations, and it was a good post-apocalypse story (or rather, woven stories). Seems this books sheds light on a common myth in media: gasoline goes bad after a couple years, so post-apocalyptic movies/games where they go for a drive? Lies! Also this book is eerie to read given it has a disease which sounds all too similar to COVID-19, yet was written years before…',

			eyebrow: 'Martha Wells',
			content: 'I read the first one in 2019 or something, and I noticed a few “Year in review 2024” posts had this series mentioned. I knew I had the `.mobi` file for the second book somewhere (it was given out for free when the third book came out I believe?), so back in I went. The story is pretty light and short but I still enjoyed it.',

			title: 'The Only One Left',
			content: 'It’s a bit of a murder mystery, and it kept me guessing a lot. There’s a bunch of characters and plot points to connect by the time you reach the end, so overall quite a good read. I was on a train for 10 hours, so I read 3/4 of the book, and finished it the same day at home — first (and last?) time I read a full book in twenty-four hours!',

			title: 'Stranger in a Strange Land',
			content: 'I got intrigued when hearing of this book via [Jason Grigsby’s article](https://cloudfour.com/thinks/that-time-some-rando-turned-me-into-a-meme-coin/). The cover sealed the deal for me because I love the dark teal and crimson combo. It’s a retro sci-fi book from the ’60s (the fiction part is way more prevalent than the science one), so beware it is a product of its time (while not a main thread, it does have some sexist undertones). I can say one thing: it went in a direction I certainly did not expect!',

I watched a couple episodes last year but got through it all earlier this year. It’s walking the line between wholesome and unhinged. The characters are total goofs who have so many flaws, but you still can’t help but love ’em.',

The main cast is endearing despite being, sometimes, terrible, and I can’t help but feel for Bob — the rest of the family gets a little too selfish at times, and then right at the end, sometimes, they kinda redeem themselves… Still, it is a mostly a wholesome show, and a particularly Christmas episode hit me right in the feels… a dang good show.',

It’s hard not to feel a little sad when a series ends, as they change cast every time, but that’s also what keeps things fresh. Caught up on series 6, and the four latest!

It actually feels like mature and of high quality — despite a couple easy tropes — written by adults and for adults (and then you’re reminded it’s a Star Wars show when a character’s name is like Greebii Booboog). The visual settings were beautiful, and there were more than one non-human character this season, if you can believe it!',

It started off slow, then got quite gripping, but fizzled up with some dubious behaviours. I liked that it was supposed to end, but, well, there’s a sequel to this show: Dexter Resurrections. (trailer seems… iffy at best) I do like Michael C. Hall’s performance though…',

			content: 'The first season was pretty good, though I wasn’t necessarily expecting another. I almost didn’t keep watching due to Pugsley’s vibes being very off-putting. It didn’t get worse, so I powered through it. Characters not communicating as a plot device is frustrating but what can you do… This felt a little lacking at times, but Thing? He killed it.',

I love how Laszlo, Nadja, and Nandor all have weird ways to say some words, Guillermo is very precious, and Colin is perfectly boring. I enjoyed these first few seasons, despite all the main cast of vampires being absolutely horrible people. I also find myself saying _“Baaat!”_ and _“[Fu-cking guyyyy…](/designs/nandor-fucking-guy/)”_ randomly, so, you know… I am enthralled.',

Yeah, you get some silliness, but, dang, for once, it felt… earned? And David Harbour’s loud Alexei character is goofy, sure, but also has some heart, so it seemed balanced. It’s not perfect, but not being mono-dimensional for a Marvel movie is rare these days, so I’ll take it.',

Some sequences were dead quiet, which can be a nice contrast, mind you, but not too much? Other scenes: quite drawn out. Tom Cruise still loves sprinting.

This was a solid album, that sounds like exactly like them yet remains new and refreshing. Also, the singer’s Scottish accent shines through on certain syllables, and that’s particularly enjoyable.',

With his bandmates Peter and Matt, they make some psychedelic-flavoured synth-rock I did not know I needed. Hall sounds very much like David Bowie, which is surprising given I mostly know him for the stone cold serial killer in Dexter, but I remember he did that Skittle musical once upon a time… Listen to "Blur", I adore it.',

This soundtrack is pretty good and varied, but unsurprisingly, I am mostly into the main single: As Alive As You Need Me to Be, which feels like a proper NIN song, whereas the rest are more atmospheric and score-like than a standalone song, but still enjoyable. Bonus point for the TRON-ified NIN logo, very rad. (Unlike the movie, apparently… blame Jared Leto? `>Y/N`)',

East felt kind of gritty, rooted, while West feels smoother and aerial, for the most part, but without losing that raw sound. They’re my favourite band, and their sound evolves, aging like fine (dandelion) wine.',

Their music is a lot more mellow compared to what I usually listen to, so it’s a good way for me to chill out and feel the music, and, maybe, just maybe, relax a little bit. This surprise album dropped right as I was heading into an extended weekend — perfect timing (just like their drummer — seeing live recordings, the guy keeps time like a machine!).

<p>Another year has gone by. I guess Smash Mouth was right: the years start comin’ and they don’t stop comin’. We can make quick eye contact and nod in understanding instead of discussing how messy the world’s goings-on have been, or how life has been tiring, so I’ll skip over all that stuff and keep it light-hearted.</p>

<p>For the most part, this is a media diet rather than a weeknote-formatted retrospective, as it’s more interesting to read given the wide timeframe — I am also skipping re-watches/re-plays: this is long enough as it is. A couple of things: you can click very discrete parts of some of the section illustrations (lil’ easter eggs for ya…), and a 👍 emoji indicates a highly recommended piece of media. Alright, here we go.</p>

			I started off so, so well. Three months, three books! Then I lost steam and didn’t read a book from April through October… (unless you count half of a friend’s book draft) Given I read nearly twice as many last year, this is bad even by my standards (admittedly, though, I am a slow reader — if you read fast, you have my admiration). Hoping to read more in 2026, so if you have recommendations, please send them my way!

			I watched a decent amount of TV shows, and I like to think it was varied. I did not get to <strong>White Lotus</strong> or <strong>Fallout</strong> — I guess I really want to watch Walton Goggins, eh? I haven’t seen the final <strong>Stranger Things</strong> season yet, but plan to in 2026, along with a rewatch of <strong>Parks and Recreation</strong>… it just needs to happen.

			There’s a lot in here, so I’ll only list new stuff (if you click the covers, you’ll get the playlist on BandCamp or YouTube) that I’ve played several times. A few special mentions:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Low Roar</strong>’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IB1URcYIaOE">Don’t Be So Serious</a> (via Death Stranding 2). Sadly the creative mind behind the project, Ryan Karazija, has passed away, but their beautiful music lives on.</li>
			<li><strong>Muse</strong>’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXmUJvNSSm0">Unravelling</a> is pretty dope, I’m here for it.</li>
			<li><strong>Venjent</strong> creates DnB songs from random video clips (as well as their own tracks). They are <em>ridiculously</em> talented, hear for yourself: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHCTTa8UP9U">Bike Alarm</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or76qIUqeVo">Sunken</a>.</li>
			<li><strong>Pat’s Soundhouse</strong> made a glorious khaen performance that starts off as a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcutNFPwXPE">car alarm</a> but ends up being so much more than that.</li>
		</ul>

			I made some time for some gaming here and there (which, compared to all other media, is a lot, when I think about it…), and it is good to see it’s been pretty diverse for me this year between adventure, puzzle, and… wheeled sports? Not included below are my (mostly) daily puzzles like <a href="https://tiledwords.com/puzzles/daily">Tiled Words</a>, <a href="https://www.morningbrew.com/games/">(mini) crosswords</a>, and <a href="https://sudoku.com/killer/expert/">expert killer sudoku</a>. I’m also really looking forward to 2026 with a few specific games like <strong>Control: Resonant</strong>, and <strong>Star Wars: Galactic Racer</strong> (and yes, <strong>GTA VI</strong>, too), in addition to my backlog, such as <strong>A Plague Tale: Requiem</strong> and <strong>Stray</strong>, and maybe <strong>Disco Elysium</strong>.

## Personal

🩸 As I had mentioned in [last year’s post](/blog/2024-as-bullet-points/), my yearly resolution would be to give blood again. And I did — twice — without fainting: great success! In the coming year, I’ll try to keep that trendline going up, or at least flat — I think I can handle it, so long as I eat enough prior!

🏃‍♂️ I completed my second half-marathon in May, in slightly rainy conditions this time, with half-assed training after a long break in the winter. I immediately took a 3-month break after the race as it was getting too hot out, and I was absolutely shattered. But hey, I did it! Now I must consider if I can repeat the feat in 2026…

🚄 Needing to get my passport renewed (I am a permanent United States resident, very fun these days), I planned a visit to the closest city with a consular office: Chicago! Having never been there, I got some recommendations over on Mastodon (thanks!), and proceeded to check out a few coffee spots, as well as the Art Institute and the 360 observation deck. The Art Deco architecture everywhere was also a real treat. I only stayed about a day due to hectic train schedules (2–10am one way, 6pm–4am the other) but really loved it, plus the weather was gorgeous.

## Work

👨‍💻 I probably worked too much, didn’t take many days off (I had too many left so they didn’t all carry over…), and that’s not good, I get whiffs of burnout here and there. I’m glad I have teammates who are good, talented humans, to make the work more fun (and who put up with my terrible puns day in and day out). I gotta learn to take a break sometimes, eh?

👕 I worked on a few designs this year: a couple of stickers (and a [new CottonBureau shop](https://cottonbureau.com/people/christopher-kirk-nielsen) with some existing designs), and commissioned work! A huge thanks to Mat Marquis for their trust on this [JavaScript for Everyone](/designs/javascript-for-everyone/) shirt, I loved working on it. I don’t do much design work any more, so I thoroughly enjoy these kinds of projects, especially because I get to design with aesthetics I like, about themes I hold dear: a perfect mix. More work to be announced…

## Web Dev Things

🐛 I found a few browser bugs! _Most_ were fixed relatively quickly, too – remember to file ’em when you see ’em! As for spec stuff, I opened a proposal as I was playing with noise textures — [background-rendering](https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/13035), anyone? — but turns out the `image-rendering` does it fine, just… not in Safari. More like _Sigh-fari_, am I right? I’ve also been frustrated with the state of styling alt text. Firefox has pretty decent options with `img::before` (see [CodePen demo](https://codepen.io/chriskirknielsen/pen/QwWBxoM)), but Chrome is limited ([issue #406271689](https://issues.chromium.org/issues/406271689)), and Safari is even more limited, but to make things worse, hides the text if it wraps ([my bug #290433](https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=290433) was marked as a duplicate of [bug #62774](https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=62774) from… 2011 🫠). I don’t expect much movement there, though I heard something about [a `:broken` pseudo-class](https://toot.cafe/@bkardell/115498354712127686)…? I also have a spec proposal stuck in purgatory — definitely not a pressing matter, but I could sometimes make use of [absolute values in a CSS `scale` transformation](https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/5273).

🎨 I made a few fun CodePen demos, like [skew-based rotation](https://codepen.io/chriskirknielsen/pen/QwbZpaa) and [frosted glass filter](https://codepen.io/chriskirknielsen/pen/xbbbRKZ). The [`<dashing-button>` component](https://codepen.io/chriskirknielsen/pen/WbQZKeR) is one of those things I had to build after seeing bad (i.e. non-existing) transitions on dashed buttons. I also riffed off of Chris Coyier’s [old school rounded tabs with fewer pseudo elements](https://codepen.io/chriskirknielsen/pen/QwyxPdq). Finally, I made [`<details>` expanding content below on a grid](https://codepen.io/chriskirknielsen/pen/MYKwjNd) (hey that’s like, tabs or something), which was initially going to be the layout for this very post, but ultimately, I abandoned it due to accessibility and cross-browser issues.

## That’s All Folks!

I might need to split these up to once every few months because this post is a little bit of a slog to read through — over 5,500 words, yikes, how did I have that much to write about? Either way, thanks for stopping by, remember to be kind, wash your behind, and hey: happy new year! 🎉

## Bonus: Details for Dorks

If you are a dork like me, here are the fonts (yay, fonts!), and inspiration for the illustrations:
- **Books:** font is [Parkly](https://simplebits.shop/products/parkly), illustration is based on a [photo by Ilinca Roman](https://unsplash.com/photos/stack-of-books-with-a-mug-on-top-JRhgwviZbqY)
- **Shows:** font is [Turbeau](https://simplebits.shop/products/turbeau), illustration is based on a cheap TV whose brand I cannot find
- **Music:** font is [Contour Generator](https://www.dafont.com/contour-generator.font), illustration is based on a Sony Walkman
- **Movies:** font is [Graph (Paris)](https://wehtt.am/fonts/#graph), illustration is based on a AnscoVision Dual 8MM/Super 8MM film projector
- **Video Games:** font is [Lkdown](https://rostype.com/lkdown/), illustration is based on a Nintendo Entertainment System controller

<p>I also had lots of fun with CSS/SVG/JS but I think that, besides thanking <a href="https://social.lol/@tylersticka/115696450792695179">Tyler Sticka for a way better solution</a> for that "Content customisation" block's legend-like style near the top, I am kind of done writing for the year. If you’re really curious about something, let me know <a href="{{ social.mastodon.url }}">on Mastodon</a>. Toodeloo!</p>
