I have added a tiny {{ svg 'no-ai', { class: 'inline-icon inline-icon--center', title: 'no A.I.' } }} symbol in the footer of my website. It’s supposed to be as unremarkable as a &copy; symbol (though I think we can all agree it basically holds no value whatsoever these days), but communicates that A.I. — the buzzword encompassing large language models, machine-learning, or neural networks, which are speeding up climate change, devaluating labour, decaying critical thinking, eroding creative expression, accelerating misinformation, and exploding consumer product prices, all while being aptly symbolised by a [chocolate starfish](https://velvetshark.com/ai-company-logos-that-look-like-buttholes) — will not be found anywhere on here. I already had “100% human-made” for a while but decided a little icon would be nice to have. (I now also have [a dedicated A.I. policy page](/ai-policy/))

I have recently seen articles that tackle fascinating topics, only to notice a caption along the lines of “image of Mars generated with ChatGPT” (when [NASA has a whole website of real, gorgeous photos](https://images.nasa.gov) that can be used), or an illustration that is 100% A.I.-generated which was 100% not necessary to illustrate the point the article is trying to make. It cheapens the end-result, and I am very tired of it. Is the technology impressive in its own right? Sure! Is it ethical and/or useful at the current scale it is being shoved down our throats? No! Keep the web creative, expressive, diverse. Keep it human and interesting — use fucking em-dashes.

It goes without saying I made it myself (ironically enough, in a programme whose initials are… A.I.). And if you want to use it? Feel free to do so! I made the footer icon into a link so you can download it with a simple click, or you can use [this link to the symbol’s SVG file](/assets/img/no-ai.svg) as well.
