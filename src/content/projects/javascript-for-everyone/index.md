Mat Marquis, a.k.a. [Wilto](https://wil.to/), reached out to me to come up with a t-shirt design that would coincide with the launch of [JavaScript for Everyone](https://piccalil.li/javascript-for-everyone). Right away, I could tell Mat knew what he wanted, and that was to nerd out with this design. We explored several ideas, and ended up with this lil’ thing: a retro-y look with a few nods here and there, and in the end, a very fun design. That ``(`#${!+[]+![]} since 1995!`)`` tagline below the main shape is actual JS you can run… But why does it run? You will have to take the course to find out!

_Note: The course logo itself was made by [Jason Bradberry](https://bsky.app/profile/jasonbradberry.bsky.social)._
