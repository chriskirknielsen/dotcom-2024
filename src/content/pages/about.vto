## Wait a minute… who are you?

I’m a French Dane, living in the USA, who used to be a designer, and who now likes to build on the web, with the web, and for the web. I am, of course, not just a web developer: I’m generally speaking a bit of a nerd (the introverted kind), which may become blatantly obvious as you read through the contents of this page.

## But Why Websites?

I used the family computer growing up to mess around on MS Paint, and moved on to Photoshop (_of course_ I had a licence key). Then I learned to edit **MySpace** pages, and eventually make entire sites (webmaster days!) before my first zit. I later studied **graphic design** for 4 years, then freelanced juggling between that, some **motion design**, and **web development** for neat clients for a few years. As it turns out, coding was my jam, which I’ve been focusing on since then.

## Side Projects
{{ /echo }}

<p>I’ve built a handful of tools like <a href="/projects/visubezier/">VisuBezier</a> and <a href="/projects/svgfm/">SVGFM</a>, and written for a couple of outlets like <a href="https://css-tricks.com/author/chriskirknielsen/" class="link-label-anchor">{{ svg 'csstricks-icon', { class: 'inline-icon inline-icon--center' } }} <span class="link-label-text">CSS-Tricks</span></a> and <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/author/chriskirknielsen/" class="link-label-anchor">{{ svg 'smashingmagazine-icon', { class: 'inline-icon inline-icon--center' } }} <span class="link-label-text">Smashing Magazine</span></a>. I still do a fair bit of design, including making <a href="/designs/">stickers/apparel</a> (mostly webdev and gaming) to scratch that itch. I’ve also made <a href="/fonts/">a few typefaces</a>, as I am a massive font dork (when I was 9, I had a CD-ROM called <em>“1001 Fonts”</em> that I proudly won at a school raffle). I have <a href="/projects/">various projects listed here</a>, some professional, some personal, all objectively very super cool. I used to make electronica music as <a href="https://chronoise.com" class="link-label-anchor">{{ svg 'chronoise-icon', { class: 'inline-icon inline-icon--center' } }} <span class="link-label-text">Chronoise</span></a> but that’s been a while… It is a very satisfying creative outlet (synthesizers!) that I highly recommend.</p>

## Hobbies

While I’m not watching as many as in the past, I still indulge in a decent amount of [movies and TV shows](https://trakt.tv/users/chriskirknielsen) (I love a good quote), and spend many hours listening to [music](/music/) every day. So much good stuff to watch, so little time! I appreciate [video games](/games/), especially narrative and puzzle games, and I enjoy reading a nice [book](http://goodreads.com/chriskirknielsen) when I’m not staring at a screen (e-ink doesn’t count, right?), despite being a pretty slow reader. I also go running semi-frequently, and have even completed a couple half-marathons — an impossible feat for my past-self!

Curiosity is part of my DNA (alongside whichever gene made me bald) and I value understanding how things work. **Oh, and I love jokes, puns, and any kind of wordplay. Yes, I love dad jokes despites not being a father — such a faux pa.**

## Languages

I grew up in Lyon, France, born to **Danish** parents. Australia was my home for a year as a child, speaking **English** with a Down Under accent (which I’ve since then lost), and I even held a baby koala. Between those and **French**, I sometimes mix things up, which can result in inadvertently funny sentences. I do know a decent amount of **Italian** but natives seem to prefer to answer me in English — <em lang="it">ché peccato</em>. I took **Japanese** in high school, but didn't apply myself (and instead learned the Cyrillic alphabet, for some reason?), so I’m not good at it, but I did learn some vocabulary thanks to DuoLingo (I stopped after my 1,000-day streak). Anyways, I find languages (and accents) fascinating! 

## Skills, a.k.a. The Professional Section {$#resume$}

I’m a creative developer, or “design engineer”, meaning I can code and design, keeping an eye on details (including fonts!). I especially shine with my front-end fluency with **HTML** (the semantic kind), **CSS** (I’m a nerd for it), and **JavaScript** (not React!), but I don’t shy away from **PHP and MySQL** (mainly for **WordPress** projects) or **Webflow**. I use **git** (any of GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket) to keep my projects neatly tracked, and like to write commented, squeaky-cleanish code. The **Adobe Creative Suite** and I go _way_ back (2005!), specifically **Photoshop, Illustrator, and After Effects**, though I’ve also gotten on the **Figma** train (sorry, Sketch!).
