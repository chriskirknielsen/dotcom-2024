    If you clicked something and it lead you here, well that's not great. If you'd be so kind, would you mind sending me a message via email (see footer) or <a href="{{ social.mastodon.url }}">on Mastodon</a> to let me know?

    {% component 'cta', { url: '/search/', label: 'Search', icon: 'search' } %}

<p>If you purposefully typed in this URL to get here, I hope you enjoyed what you got. Also, that's a weird hobby you have… we should be friends.</p>
