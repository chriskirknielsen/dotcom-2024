## But Why Websites?

I used the family computer growing up to mess around on MS Paint, and moved on to Photoshop (_of course_ I had a licence key). Then I learned to edit MySpace pages, and eventually make entire sites (webmaster days!) before my first zit. I later studied **graphic design** for 4 years, then freelanced juggling between that, some **motion design**, and **web development** for neat clients for a few years. As it turns out, coding was my jam, which I've been focusing on since then. (I became a [CSS](/css-logo/) nerd, whoops)

## Side Projects

{% endrenderTemplate %}
<p>I've built a handful of tools like <a href="/projects/visubezier/">VisuBezier</a> and <a href="/projects/svgfm/">SVGFM</a>, and written for a couple of outlets like <a href="https://css-tricks.com/author/chriskirknielsen/">{% svg 'csstricks-logo', { class: 'inline-icon inline-icon--middle' } %}</a> and <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/author/chriskirknielsen/">{% svg 'smashingmagazine-logo', { class: 'inline-icon inline-icon--center' } %}</a>. I still do a fair bit of design, including making <a href="/designs/">stickers/apparel</a> (mostly webdev and gaming) to scratch that itch. I've also made <a href="/fonts/">a few typefaces</a>, as I am a massive font nerd (when I was 9, I had a CD-ROM called "1001 Fonts" for crying out loud). I have <a href="/projects/">various projects listed here</a>, some professional, some personal, all objectively very super cool. I used to make electronica music as <a href="https://chronoise.com">{% svg 'chronoise-logo', { class: 'inline-icon inline-icon--center' } %}</a> but that's been a while… It is a very satisfying creative outlet (synthesizers!), which I highly recommend.</p>

## Hobbies

While I'm not watching as many as in the past, I still indulge in a decent amount of movies and TV shows (I love a good quote). So much good stuff to watch, so little time! I appreciate [video games](/games/), especially narrative and puzzle games, and I enjoy reading a lot when I'm not staring at a screen (e-ink doesn't count, right?), despite being a pretty [slow reader](http://goodreads.com/chriskirknielsen). I also run, which is not something I'd ever have thought myself capable of doing, and yet…!

Curiosity is part of my DNA (alongside the bald gene!) and I treasure understanding how things work. **Oh, and I love (dad) jokes, puns, and any kind of wordplay.**

## Languages

I find languages fascinating! I grew up in Lyon, France, born to **Danish** parents. Australia was my home for a year as a child, speaking **English** with a Down Under accent, and I even held a baby koala. So if I blurt a word in **French**, sorry, three languages just keep blending in my noggin. I do know a decent amount of **Italian** but natives seem to prefer to answer me in English — _ché peccato_. I took **Japanese** in high school, but didn't apply myself (and instead learned to read the Cyrillic alphabet for some reason?), so I'm not good at it, but I did learn some vocabulary thanks to DuoLingo (I stopped after my 1,000-day streak).

## Skills, a.k.a. The Professional Section

I'm a "creative developer", or "design engineer", meaning I can code and design, keeping an eye on details (including fonts!). **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** (not React!) are my primary tools, but I don't shy away from **PHP and MySQL** (especially for WordPress projects). I use **git** to keep my projects neatly tracked, and like to write squeaky-clean code. I'm very comfortable with the Adobe Creative Suite, especially **Photoshop, Illustrator, and After Effects**, and I've also become good buds with **Figma** by now.
