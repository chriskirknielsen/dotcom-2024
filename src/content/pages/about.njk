## But Why Websites?

I used the family computer growing up to mess around on MS Paint, and moved on to Photoshop (_of course_ I had a licence key). Then I learned to edit MySpace pages, and eventually make entire sites (webmaster days!) before my first zit. I later studied **graphic design** for 4 years, then freelanced juggling between that, some **motion design**, and **web development** for neat clients for a few years. Turns out coding was my calling, which I've been focusing on since then. (I became a CSS nerd, whoops)

## Side Projects

I've built a handful of tools like [VisuBezier](/projects/visubezier/) and [SVGFM](/projects/svgfm/), and written for a couple of outlets like [CSS-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/author/chriskirknielsen/) (RIP) and [Smashing Magazine](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/author/chriskirknielsen/). I still do a fair bit of design, including making [stickers/apparel](/designs/) (mostly webdev and gaming) to scratch that itch. I've also made [a few typefaces](/fonts/), as I am a massive font nerd (when I was 9, I had a CD-ROM called "1001 Fonts" for crying out loud). I have [various projects listed here](/projects/), some professional, some personal, all totally very super cool. I also used to make [electronica music as Chronoise](https://chronoise.com) but that's been a while… It is a very satisfying creative outlet (synthesizers!), which I highly recommend.

## Hobbies

While I'm not watching as many as in the past, I still indulge in a decent amount of movies and TV shows (I love a good quote). So much good stuff to watch, so little time! I appreciate [video games](/games/), especially narrative and puzzle games, and I enjoy reading a lot when I'm not staring at a screen (e-ink doesn't count, right?), despite being a pretty [slow reader](http://goodreads.com/chriskirknielsen). I also run, which is not something I'd ever have thought myself capable of doing, and yet…!

Curiosity is part of my DNA (alongside the bald gene!) and I treasure understanding how things work. **Oh, and I love (dad) jokes, puns, and any kind of wordplay.**

## Languages

I find languages fascinating! I grew up in Lyon, France, born to **Danish** parents. Australia was my home for a year as a child, speaking **English** with a Down Under accent, and I even held a baby koala. So if I blurt a word in **French**, sorry, three languages just keep blending in that bald head of mine. I do know a decent amount of **Italian** but natives seem to prefer to answer me in English. I took **Japanese** in high school, but didn't apply myself (and instead learned to read the Cyrillic alphabet?), so I'm not good at it, but I'm "learning" again with DuoLingo (mostly vocabulary).

## Skills, a.k.a. The Professional Section

I'm a "creative developer", a.k.a. "design engineer", meaning I can code and design, keeping an eye on details (including fonts!). **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** (not React!) are my primary tools, but I don't shy away from **PHP and MySQL** (especially for WordPress projects). I use **git** to keep my projects neatly tracked, and like to write squeaky-clean code. I'm very comfortable with the Adobe Creative Suite, especially **Photoshop, Illustrator, and After Effects**, and I've become good buds with **Figma** at this point.
