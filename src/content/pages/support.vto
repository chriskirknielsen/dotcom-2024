<h2>For free</h2>
<p>Whatever content of mine that brought you some kind of serotonin might be something youâ€™d feel like sharing to a friend, perchance? Remember that 1 sharing equals 1 caring.</p>

<h2>Indirectly</h2>
<p>Most of the apparel items you see on my {{ component 'cta', { label: "Designs page", url: "/designs/" } }} will provide some commission for me in case of purchase, so if my work looks like something youâ€™d like to wear or stick on your laptop, thatâ€™s an easy win-win. Sharing that link is also helpful, so whatever you do, thanks!</p>

<h2>Right in my pocket</h2>
<p>If youâ€™re desperate to give me money, you can get yourself a shirt from the link above. If you donâ€™t need clothes/stickers, Iâ€™m on both {{ component 'cta', { label: 'BuyMeACoffee', url: metadata.support.buymeacoffee, icon: 'icon-buymeacoffee', iconBefore: true } }} and {{ component 'cta', { label: 'Ko-Fi', url: metadata.support.kofi, icon: 'icon-kofi', iconBefore: true } }}, but I do not publish anything there, and quite frankly, Iâ€™d rather you donated to your local animal shelter or LGBTQ+ group (or any other cause you believe in) â€” that works for me!Â ðŸ’œ</p>
